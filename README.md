#  GP2Y0E0 configuration with I2C Example using ESP32

## Overview

This example demonstrates I2C GP2Y0E0 configuration to change I2c addres and read distance value:

1. Read external I2C sensor, here we take the GP2Y0E03 distance sensor  for an example.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

To run this example, you should have one ESP32 dev board (e.g. ESP32-WROVER Kit) or ESP32 core board (e.g. ESP32-DevKitC). Optionally, you can also connect an external sensor, here we choose the GP2Y0E03 just for an example. GP2Y0E03 is a GP2Y0E03 is a ir distance measuring sensor, for more information about it, you can read the [PDF](https://global.sharp/products/device-china/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp2y0e03_e.pdf) of this sensor.

#### Pin Assignment:

**Note:** The following pin assignments are used by default, yout can change these  in the `menuconfig` .

|                  | SDA    | SCL    |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ |
| GP2Y0E03.c Sensor    | SDA    | SCL    |


- master:
  - GPIO18 is assigned as the data signal of I2C master port
  - GPIO19 is assigned as the clock signal of I2C master port

- Connection:
  - connect SDA/SCL of GP2Y0E03 sensor with GPIO18/GPIO19

**Note: ** Thereâ€™s no need to add an external pull-up resistors for SDA/SCL pin, because the driver will enable the internal pull-up resistors.

### Configure the project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`). Then go into `Example Configuration` menu.

### Build and Flash

Enter `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output


## Troubleshooting

- GP2Y0E03 has two I2C address, which is decided by the voltage level of `ADDR` pin at start up. Make sure to check your schemetic before run this example.
